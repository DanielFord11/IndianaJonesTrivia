# IndianaJonesTrivia

This is an Indiana Jones trivia game. I plan to circle back to make it look great with styling and art from the movies. Below are the MVP requirements

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

WHEN I click the start button

THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question

THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly

THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over

THEN I can save my initials and score
